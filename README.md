Quick estimates of 

- Proportion of respondents aged 18-30 who have no parent with a BA
- Proportion of respondents with a BA who have no parent with a BA

Notes: 

- To be counted as having no parent with a degree, respondents must have provided information about both parents. 
- To be counted as having at least one parent with a degree, respondents need only provide information about one parent. 
- Proportions are survey-weighted means.
- Different approaches to excluding what's missing will produce different proportions.
